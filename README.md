# Hotdog-Not-Hotdog
An exercise I learned in Udemy that is similar to Jinyang's app of hotdog or not hotdog app.

> PS. Jinyang is a reference to the TV Series Silicon Valley

What I Learned
- Use of CoreML model (InceptionV3) grabbed from Apple's available set of library
- Use of ImagePicker to capture photo of a potential hotdog
